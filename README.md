1.1 Tasks:  
a. Defining the reasonable hierarchies for the 4 Quasi-identifiers [age, education, marital
status and race] 

➢ Age: When you look at the raw adult data, exact ages are mentioned, those ages are 
generalized into specific intervals.

The current level generalization in the age hierarchy is 2. 
The maximum level generalization in the age hierarchy is 4. 

➢ Education: There was no need to generalize the education attribute in the quasi-identifier. 
To quantify the analysis of the dataset by keeping the attribute as it is.
